# genMusic

genMusic is an instrument, played using mouse input and/or HotHand and the software i-score (https://github.com/OSSIA/i-score).
The graphics are inspired by the works of Swiss graphic designer Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockman, and more precisely by his posters for Musica Viva.

It is an openFrameworks application, using the following addons:

* ofxGui (for the interface)
* ofxMaxim (for sound synthesis)
* ofxOSSIA (for controlling parameters using i-score)

**Tested OS**

Tested only on Linux (debian/stretch and antergos)

Be careful of your PC's volume while testing genMusic ...
